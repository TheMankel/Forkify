# Forkify
Forkify is a vanilla JavaScript application that interacts with the Forkify API to fetch and display recipe food data. The user can search for a specific recipe, and save to a favorites list via local storage. The user can easily increase or decrease servings as per his need and can view detailed directions. The application was built as the final project of a JavaScript course by Jonas Schmedtmann.
